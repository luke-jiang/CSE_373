     * a. Accepts some long as input (the 'n'). The exact meaning of 'n' is entirely up to the tester function.
     * b. Runs some arbitrary test.
     * c. Returns some number indicating the final result. This number could be the time it took to run
     *    some code, the amount of memory used...
     *
     * The 'inputs' list must contains all of the different values of 'n' we want to try testing.
     *
     * This method will take each item inside 'input', pass them one by one into the testerFunction,
     * and return a list containing the corresponding outputs.
     *
     * NOTE: this helper method is appropriate mainly when trying to test something that's *deterministic*:
     * that's guaranteed to return the same result each time.
     *
     * If you want to test something that has some degree of randomness (e.g. testing how long it takes
     * for some code to run), you should try using the 'runTrials' helper method below.
